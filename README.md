# Sensor-Based-Physics-Forceps-for-Tooth-Extraction
This project uses sensors to monitor the force applied during dental extractions, adjusting for patient factors like age. A buzzer alerts the dentist if the pressure exceeds safe limits. It also tracks the rocking and twisting movements during extraction, providing real-time feedback to minimize complications and enhance safety.
